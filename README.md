# Networks with Delays

TODO:
- Update rule is whacky (looks for first instance of cell on and then updates linearly)
- Look for central pattern generators
- Try to model progression of evolution of neural systems (simple neural nets in jelly fish --> vertebrate systems etcs)
- Implement skewed distribution of initial neurons
- inferring connectivity from just nodes
- Apply firing rates taken from probability distributions to nodes
